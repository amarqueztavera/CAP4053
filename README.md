UNFIXED BUGS(KNOWN):
*Note Jigsaw- Placing a puzzle piece in to the correct spot when an incorrect puzzle piece is already placed in that spot will not
 allow the player to retrieve the incorrect piece. The correct piece has already fixed in place on top of it. Must reset puzzle by exiting.
*Color flow- Will allow you to complete it incorrectly by overlapping lines.
